-> Lattice Points:
    Lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers.
    The amount of lattice points of a segment a-b will be gcd( abs((b - a).x), abs((b - a).y))

-> Pick's Theorem:
    The area of a polygon = Number of Lattice points inside + Lattice points on the boundary / 2 - 1.
    Area = i + b/2 - 1
